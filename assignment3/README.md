## Question 3

Implementation for functional requirements and use case scenarios above were implemented in ExampleSeleniumTest.java.

Note that we had issues with the appliction not running the server, so we had to comment out lines 30-34 (the lines that are responsible for running the server). Instead, we ran the app in a different terminal before running the tests.

Below are the results of running the 15 test cases that were implemented.
